Joseph Ritchie
Iâ€™m from Easley, SC. I completed my undergraduate degree in Music Education at Winthrop University in Rock Hill, SC. I got married this past May, and my wife and I adopted a female golden retriever named Piper at the end of June. I am currently pursuing my Masters in Music Performance. I am the graduate assistant for the tuba and euphonium studio.
